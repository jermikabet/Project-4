   <h2> Directions </h2>

   <ol>

  <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. </li>
   
  <li> Place the potatoes on a baking sheet. Rub them with butter and bake for 1 hour, making sure they're sufficiently cooked through.</li>
   
  <li> Slice the butter into pats. Place in a large mixing bowl and add the bacon bits and sour cream. Remove the potatoes from the oven. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F. </li>
   
  <li> With a sharp knife, cut each potato in half lengthwise. Scrape out the insides into the mixing bowl, being careful not to tear the shell. Leave a small rim of potato intact for support. Lay the hollowed out potato shells on a baking sheet. </li>
   
  <li> This video shows how to hollow out a potato  <a href= "https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=how+to+hollow+out+a+potato&view=detail&mid=5B3E0B6A0B7BF4B41DFF5B3E0B6A0B7BF4B41DFF&FORM=VIRE">"Recipe for Twice Baked Potatoes : Hollow out Potatoes for Twice Baked Potatoes Recipe"</a> </li>
   
  <li> Smash the potatoes into the butter, bacon and sour cream. Add the cheese, milk, seasoned salt, green onions and black pepper to taste and mix together well. <strong> If you plan to freeze the twice-baked potatoes, do NOT add the green onions.</strong> </li>
   
  <li> Fill the potato shells with the filling. I like to fill the shells so they look abundant and heaping. Top each potato with a little more grated cheese and pop 'em in the oven until the potato is warmed through, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
   
  </ol>

   <h1>Foot Notes</h1> 
   
   <p> Before putting the potatoes in the oven stab them with a frok multiple times on both side <strong> if not they will explode </strong> </p>
   <p> ReynoldsÂ® Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.</p>
